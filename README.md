# Project Overview
This project is about data cleaning and transformation to ensure quality by delving into the fascinating world of Diabetes Prediction using a Kaggle dataset. This involved techniques like handling missing values, identifying and correcting inconsistencies, handling Outliers and ensuring data format consistency. As well as performing an Exploratory Data Analysis to get a sense of the distribution of variables and their relationships.
# About Dataset
The Diabetes Prediction Dataset contains a collection of medical and demographic features (age, BMI, hypertension, etc.) associated with patients' diabetes status (positive/negative), enabling analysis and prediction of diabetes risk.
# Goal of the Project
To uncover hidden patterns and prepare the data for accurate prediction models.
# Data Sourcing
A Kaggle Dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset
